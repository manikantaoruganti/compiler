# 🧠 Online Multi-Language Code Compiler

An **online multi-language code compiler** that allows users to write, compile, and execute code through a web-based interface.
The project is designed with a **custom execution engine**, **modular runtime logic**, and **secure code handling**, making it suitable for educational and practical use cases.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project provides a unified platform to execute programs written in multiple programming languages from a single interface.

It focuses on:

* Clean and responsive UI
* Efficient compilation and execution flow
* Modular and extensible architecture
* Secure runtime management

---

## ✨ Key Features

* 🌐 Online code compilation and execution
* 🧠 Multi-language support
* 🧩 Modular compiler and runtime design
* ⚙️ Custom execution logic
* 🖥️ Interactive web interface
* 🔒 Secure and controlled code execution

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

* **Custom Module Loader**
  Handles dynamic loading and execution of compiler components.

* **Environment-Aware Runtime**
  Detects and adapts to the execution environment for reliable behavior.

* **Secure Execution Flow**
